# Configuration tools

This directory contains
- ``.pylintrc``: The pylint settings I'll be using to test your code.
- ``environment.yml``: The conda environment file I'm running on my machine.

I may update these files periodically as the semester progresses, so it would be a good idea to subscribe to changes on GitHub.
